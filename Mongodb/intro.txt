MongoDB : Mongodb is a NOSQL document based database which is used to store the data in the form of documents.
collections are like tables  and inside documents are like rows(individual).
Each document is a JSON - like object (BSON - binary JSON) which contains field and value pairs.
{
    "_id":"56874658736e875346", (auto generated)
    "name":"raj",
    "age":24,
    "email":"a@a.com"
}

collection   --- similar to table
document     --- similar to row
field        --- similar to column

Download & Install Mongodb:
    goto this website: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download and download
        i. mongodb community server
        ii. mongodb compass(GUI)
        iii. mongodb shell(CLI - Mongosh)

Difference between MySQL and MongoDB:
   MySQL is RDBMS(relational database management system)  and MongoSB is NoSQL document based database
   IN MySQL data is stored in tables(row & columns). In Mongodb data is stored within collections(documents & fields)
   MySQL , structure is fixed. In MongoDB , structure is dynamic
   MySQL follows ACID principles .MongoDB follows BASE principles(mainly focus on scalability)
   applications like banking, ERP, analytics uses mySQL. social media apps, ecommerce, real time analytics applications uses mongoDB.
   mySQL can handle large amount of data but takes lot of memory and a bit slow
   MongoDB is ideal for not heavy data, mainly used for transactional data. it takes less space and very fast

MongoDB Compass  -- it is a GUI (graphical user interface tool) which is used to do operations on databases . it is similar to workbench in mySQL
MongoDB shell --- it is a CLI (command line interface tool) which is used to do operations on databases in command prompts. it is also called as Mongosh


commands : open mongodb compass and create a connection. select the connection and open mongodb shell. try the below commands
   show databases --- display all the databases
   use databaseName --- switch to the particular database. we can use this command even before db created. In MongoDB, databases don't exist without atleast one collection.
   db.createCollection('collectionName') -- it is used to create collection
   show collections -- it is used to display all collections
   delete collection -- db.collectionName.drop();

   MongoDB Data Modelling:   Data in MongodB has flexible schema documents in the same collection.They do not need to have same structure. We can design data model in mongodb in 2 ways
   i.Embedded data model : In this model, all the data that is needed will be within single document. it is also called de normalized data model
    {
        "_id":4354ve543f3,
        "name":{
            "first":"shekhar",
            "last":"prasad
        },
        "contact":{
            "phone":4534353,
            "email":"a@a.com"
        }
    }
   ii. normalized data model: Tn this data model, we will use  a reference value to connect multiple documents which contains our data.
   {
    "_id":4354ve543f3,
    "empID":11223344
   }
   {
    "empID":11223344,
    "firstName":"shekhar",
    "lastNAme":"prasad"
   }
   {
    "empID":11223344,
    "phone":4534353,
    "email":"a@a.com"
   }
