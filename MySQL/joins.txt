Joins : Joins are used to get data by combining multiple tables. Each table will have a relation with another table.Primary keys in one table becomes foreign keys in another table

   Joins are divided as multiple types such as
    i. inner join
   ii. left join
  iii. right join
   iv. full outer join
   v. self join

i. inner join: it is used to display the rows which are common in both tables. it matches values between tables and only matched results will be on display.
    syntax: 
         select t1.column1,t2.column2.......
         from table1 as t1
         inner join 
         table2 as t2
         on t1.common_column = t2.common_column

ii. left join : it is used to display the complete rows of left table and common data from right table. incase of values which are present only on left table , it automatically fills null on result
    syntax: 
         select t1.column1,t2.column2.......
         from table1 as t1
         left join 
         table2 as t2
         on t1.common_column = t2.common_column

iii. right join : it is used to display the complete rows of right table and common data from left table . Incase of values which are present only on right table, it automatically fills null on result
    syntax: 
         select t1.column1,t2.column2.......
         from table1 as t1
         right join 
         table2 as t2
         on t1.common_column = t2.common_column

iv. full outer join : it is not possible to do full outer join directly in MySQL. There is way to achieve this using 'UNION'. UNION is used to combine results of multiple queries
   left join query
    union
   right join query

v. self join : it is used to combine a single table to itself. we assume the single table as two tables and make a relation between them

  syntax is same as left or inner or right joins


Sub Queries: Sub Queries are the Queries which are performed on the result of nested Query (Query inside another Query), always it performs nested queries first
  syntax:  select column
           from table 
           where column2 = (select column1 
                            from table
                            where condition)

Write a Query to print all the employees name and salary whose salary is greater than average salary

select ename,salary
from employees
where salary > (select avg(salary)
                from employees);

There are different types of Sub Queries Such as : 
      i. scalar SubQuery : This subQuery results/returns only single value
      ii. Row SubQuery : This subQuery returns single Row
      iii.column SubQuery : This subQuery returns single column (multiple rows)
      iv. Table SubQuery : This SubQuery returns a table result
      v. corelated subqueries : it refers to the columns of outer query, it will execute once per outer row

2. Write a Query to find sum of salaries of employees who are india or US

select sum(salary)
from employees
where eid IN (select eid
from employees
where country = "india" || country = "us");*/  
-- write a query to print cname who bought
-- "mouse" in orders table


3. write a query to print the employee names whose salary is greater than the average salary of their own department
