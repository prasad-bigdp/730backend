Indexes in mySQL: Indexes are used to improve the efficiency and performance of Queries. It helps in retrieving the data faster than without index . It exactly works like textbook indexes . Indexes can be applied to single or multiple columns
   for eg: if i execute a query
          select * from employees where ename = "prasad"
    if there is no index for ename, mySQL checks every row(also called full table scan)
    if index is available , mySQL can directly jump to the matching rows

    syntax : create index index_name ON table_name(column_name)
    we can remove the index using drop index index_name ON table_name
    To see all indexes , we can use show index from table_name

Always primary keys creates an index primary index, uniques ones have unique index . indexes which are created on multiple columns are called composite index

Triggers in mySQL : A trigger is a block of SQL code that automatically runs when an event occurs in a table.
   Mostly triggers are used to validate the data before inserting , log the changes etc..,
   syntax : 
   create trigger trigger_name
   (before|after) (insert|update|delete)
   ON table_name
   FOR EACH Row
   Begin
       ---- code
   END

EG :
delimiter //
create trigger basicTigger
after insert on employees
for each row
begin
   insert into 
   log_table (message)
   values
   (CONCAT(NEW.ename,'new employee is added'));
end//

we can use keywords NEW and OLD to refer the new and old values of the rows
we can remove the trigger using drop trigger trigger_name


Views in mySQL :  views are like a virtual table that is based on the result of a SQL Query
   create : 
        create view indians as  
        select ename,salary,gender from employees where country = "india"

   Query : select * from indians

   Update : we can update a view only if view is based on single table and does not contains joins or aggregations functions
 for eg: update indians
set salary = 30000
where ename = "peter"

it also edits "peter" salary in original table

we can delete view using  "drop view viewName"

views will not perform insert or delete


Stored Procedures:   A stored Procedure is a set of SQL statements stored to the database that can be executed as a unit. They are used in encapsulating logic, removes redundancy  and improve performance

   syntax : 
            delimiter //
            create Procedure Procedure_name(parameters)
            Begin 
                   -- statements
            End //
            delimiter ;

   Eg: delimiter //
create procedure countryWise(IN c varchar(20))
begin
    select * from employees
    where country = c;
end //
delimiter ;

call countryWise("canada");

create a stored procedure which tells employee details based on department

 delimiter //
create procedure countryWise(IN dn varchar(20))
begin
    select * from employees where dept_id = (select did from departments where dname = dn)
end //
delimiter ;

create  a stored procedure which tells number of employeed based on department


functions :
  functions are used to perform calculations and return a single value. they are similar to stored procedures but they can be used in SQL statements like select, where etc..,
   syntax :
        delimiter //
        create function function_name(parameters) returns datatype (determinstic/ reads sql data)
        begin
            -- code
            return value;
        end //
        delimiter ;
   use: 
        select function_name(arguments);
   These are also called user defined functions(UDF)
   eg: create a function which returns the total salary of a department
   create function totalSalary(did int)
returns int reads sql data
begin
    declare total int;
     set total = (select sum(salary) 
     from employees where dept_id = did);
    return total;
end //
delimiter ;

 select totalSalary(202);

 2. write a function to add two numbers and returns it
delimiter //
create function addNumbers(a int,b int)
returns int deterministic
begin
    declare c int;
    set c = a+b;
    return c;
end //
delimiter ;

select addNumbers(10,5);

3. write a function that takes radius and returns area of circle
delimiter //
Create function circleArea(r int)
Returns decimal(10,3) deterministic
Begin
Declare a decimal(10,3);
set a= 3.14XrXr;
Return a
End//
Delimiter;

There are some default and pre defined functions such as 
   i. aggregate functions:  sum(),count(),max(),min(),avg(),group_concat()
   ii. string functions : concat(str1,str2),length(str),
                          LCASE/UCASE (str),replace(str,from,to),
                          left(str,a)/right(str,a), trim(str)
select concat("java","script"),length("my sql"),
       replace("sql","s","p"),
       left("databas",4),trim(" hello ");*/
select ucase("john")       
   iii. math functions : abs(x),ceil(x)/floor(x),round(x,d),power(x,y),
                         mod(x,y),rand()
   select abs(-22),mod(5,3),power(5,3),ceil(2.1),
floor(2.8),round(3.1458968,2),RAND()

   iv. date functions:  NOW()  -- current date & time
                        CURDATE()/CURTIME()  -- current date/time
                        YEAR(date)/month(date)/day(date) -- it extracts year/,onth/day from date, DATEDIFF(date1,date2) -- difference in days , 
                        note: date should be in format YYYY-MM-DD.
