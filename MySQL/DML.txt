DML( Data Manipulation Language):
                     It is used to manipulate the data such as inserting the data, updating the data and deleting the data
   1. Insert the data : To insert data into table we can use below syntax like
        insert into tableNAme values (col1 value,col2 value,....)
for multi row insert
        insert into tableNAme values (col1 value,col2 value,....),(col1 value,col2 value,....),(col1 value,col2 value,....),(col1 value,col2 value,....)......
for specific column insert
        insert into tableName(col1, col3,col5) values(col1 value, col3 value, col5 value)

  2. Update the data: it is used to modify/update the existing data but we need to specify WHERE clause to detect which row should be updated. If there is no WHERE, it updates in complete table(all rows)
       UPDATE tablename
       SET columnName = value
       WHERE CONDITION;
change salary of "john" to 10000.00
       UPDATE employees
       SET salary = 10000.00
       WHERE ename="john"

  3. Delete the data : it is used to delete the existing data but we need to specify WHERE clause to detect which row should be deleted . If there is no WHERE, it deletes complate table data(all rows)
       DELETE FROM tablename
       WHERE condition;
    delete details of people whose country is "US"
      delete from employees where country="US";

-- Task : create a database office and use it. create a table staff with details staff_id, staff_name, staff_age(should be >18), staff_salary, staff_role. perform following queries
