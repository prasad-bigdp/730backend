Operators : operators are used to perform operations . Based on operation, we can divide them as:
    i. Arithematic Operators : + , - , * ,/, % (remainder)
   ii. Relational or comparison operators :  > , < ,>= ,<= ,= , != (<>),
       between....AND  ------ used for a specific range
       In   --- matches any value in a list
       Like --- it is used for a pattern
       IS NULL --- checks for null values
       IS NOT NULL --- checks for NOT NULL values
 DQL(Data Query Language) : These commands are used to perform Queries 
  Eg: SELECT
  SELECT used to select specific columns or data from given table and displays it

1.  Display all rows and columns from employees table
      select * from employees
2.  Display only ename and salary columns from employees table
     select ename,salary from employees
3. Display all employees ename and salary whose salary is greater than 20000
   select ename,salary
from employees
where salary>20000;

4. Display employees ename and salary who salary is less than or equals to 20000
select ename,salary
from employees
where salary<=20000;

5.Display employees ename, gender and salary who country is not india
select ename,gender,salary
 from employees where country!="india"

6. Display employees ename and salary whose salary is between 15000 and 30000
   select ename,salary
   from employees 
   where salary between 15000 and 30000

7. Display employees ename and salary whose country is in the list of "us" or "uk" 
   select ename,salary
   from employees
   where country IN ("US","UK");

8. Display employees ename, salary whose salary is null
 select ename,salary
   from employees
   where salary IS NULL;

9.  DISPLAY employees ename and salary whose name starts with 'p'
  select ename, salary
  from employees
  where ename LIKE 'p%'
eg: p , pa,pin,pink,pdkdhfkjxvbfkj

10.DISPLAY employees ename and salary whose name ends with 'a'
select ename, salary
  from employees
  where ename LIKE '%a'

11.DISPLAY employees ename and salary whose name second letter should be 'e'
select ename, salary
  from employees
  where ename LIKE '_e%'
11.DISPLAY employees ename and salary whose name second letter  from last is  'e'
select ename, salary
  from employees
  where ename LIKE '%e_'



  iii. logical operators : These operators are used to combine multiple conditions such as 
           Logical and (AND / &&)  --- True only if both conditions are true
           OR  -- True if any one of the condition is true
           NOT(!) -- True if condition results false
           XOR   --  True if exactly one condition is true
    12. Write a query to retrieve employees ename and salary and country who are from either UK or Canada
     select ename, salary, country
from employees
where country = "UK" or country ="Canada";

    13. Write a query to retrieve employees ename, gender , salary whose salary is greater than 20000 and gender is male

select ename, gender, salary from employees where salary > 20000 AND gender = 'M';

Sort : sort is used to sort out the results either in ascending order or descending order. for sorting in mysql, we will use "ORDER BY"
   select columns
   from table name
   where condition
   order by column asc/desc;
14. Print / display employees details according to their salaries in increasing order
    select eid,ename,salary
from employees
order by salary ;

15. Display employees details who are from uk or india with their names in alphabetical order

select ename, gender, salary, country from employees
 where country = 'UK' || country = 'india' 
ORDER BY ename;

LIMIT: it is used to restrict number of rows in the result
   LIMIT number;

16. Display Top 3 highest paid employees names and salary
select eid,ename,salary
from employees
order by salary desc
LIMIT 3;

17. Display the Highest Paid Employee name and salary
select ename,salary
from employees
order by salary desc
LIMIT 1;

OFFSET : it is used to skip certain rows before limit
OFFSET number;

 18. Display employee name,id and salary  whose salary is second lowest
select eid,ename,salary
from employees
order by salary desc
limit 1 offset 1;

Group By :  The Group By clause is used to arrange identical data in groups. it can be used with aggregate fubctions like count(),sum(),max(),min(),avg() etc..,. These functions allows us to perform calculation on groups
   syntax: 
            select column1, agreegate_function(column2)
            from tableName
            group by column1

  1. using group by , print how many males or females are existed in employees table
select gender, count(eid) as no_of_people
from employees
group by gender;

 2. using group by , print how many people are from each country in employees table

select country , count(eid) as no_of_people
from employees
group by country

3. using group by, print how many males and female in employees table whose salry is greater than 20000
select gender, count(eid) as no_of_people
from employees
where salary > 20000
group by gender


having : having is the condition that is applied after group by . it used to filter groups .

4. print the employees countries whose no_of_people count is greater than 1
select country, count(eid) as no_of_people
from employees
group by country 
having no_of_people>1

5. print Indians from employees, gender wise count only of the count is greater than 2
select gender, count(eid) as no_of_people
from employees
where country = "india"
group by gender
having no_of_people>2

Aggregate Functions:  These functions are used to perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single value per group or per table
   i. count :  count is used to count the number of rows 
        find total how many employees are in office
        select count(*) as total_employees
from employees;
  
   ii. sum : sum is used to return total of numerical column
       Find the total salary given to employees
select sum(salary)
from employees;
    find the total salaries based on genders
    select gender,count(eid), sum(salary)
from employees
group by gender

  iii. avg : avg is used to returns average of a numerical column
    find average salary based on country in employees table
     select country, avg(salary)
     from employees
     group by country

  iv. max : it is used to return the maximum value(largest value) in the column
     find the highest salary based on gender in employees table
     select gender,max(salary)
from employees
group by gender

  v. min : it is used to return the minimum value (lowest value) in the column
       find the lowest salary based on gender in employees table
        select gender,min(salary)
from employees
group by gender

vi.  group_concat(): it is used to return a concatenated string of values from the group
     Display number of people based on gender along with their names in employees table
select gender, count(eid), group_concat(ename)
from employees
group by gender;
