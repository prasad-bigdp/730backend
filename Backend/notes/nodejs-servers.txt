Servers in NodeJS:
Server : we can build API's and responding servers using nodejs core module 'http'. http module have a method createServer which takes a callback function with parameters request and response
const http = require('http')
const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{})

here req is request by client  which contains properties like 
req.url ---> url of requested client
req.method ---> method of requested client(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)
req.headers ---> headers of requested client

res is response given by server 
res.writeHead(statuscode,statusmessage,headers)
res.write(data)  -- it is the response body
res.end() -- it is the end of res
