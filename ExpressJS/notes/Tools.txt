swagger : swagger is used to setup basic DOCS API. it is used as a API documentation
like get/users -- get all users
GET/users/[id]  -- get user by id
POST/users  -- create a user

npm i swagger-jsdoc swagger-ui-express

rate LIMITS :  for example someone is accessing your API multiple times. you can restrict based on IP,based on count,based on user
like specific user can attempt login request per day 3 times

npm i express-rate-limit

we can also use redis (it is a special database for caching)
npm i redis rate-limit-redis

Input validation : we have to validate all inputs received by server from client like username,email,password. most used validator package is JOI
npm i JOI

for more security probelms like cross site scripting(XSS),clickjacking, cache poising etc.., we can use package "helmet"
npm i helmet

Docker: docker is used for containization. for eg: some code is working in my system because i have latest configuration. it may not work exactly same in your system.Docker solve this
