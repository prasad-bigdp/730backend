Authentication: Authentication verifies users credentials and check whether user existed or not. like exactly who the user is?
eg: login with email/passwors, Mobile number with OTP, Google etc..,

Authorization: Authorization verifies what user can do? it defines what actions an autheticated user is allowed to perform
eg: In amazon, customers can view products and buy
dealers/sellers can upload products, manage and sell

Types of Authentication: There are several ways to Authenticate an user. They are:
  i. Basic Authentication: it is based on username and password. here, header is not secured. it is used in early APIs
  ii. session based Authentication: here, server stores a session ID with cookies . it keeps the login the session is active , later session will be expires forcing user to login again
  iii. Token based Authentication(JWT): Here, server issues a signed token and client stores it.
  iv. oAuth/Single sign on(SSO): makes the user signup/login with third party accounts like Google, facebook, Github etc..,
  v.2FA/OTP : Here, users verifies the numbers/mails and send the OTP to verify them(email -- SMTP , sms -- sms services)
  vi. API KEY Auth --  verifies users based on their provided API Key

  JWT : JWT stands for JSON Web Tokens
  How it works is.
    -- user sends email and password  -- /login
    -- server verifies email and password
    -- server generated JWT token signed with some secret Key
    -- server sends token to client
    -- client stores this token(localstorage/sessionStorage/cookies)
    -- next time requests from client -- client sends token in Authorization header
    -- server verifies that token using secret Key
    -- if valid, access is granted

Every JWT contains header.payload.signature
header contains type, algorithms etc..,
payload contains user details like id , name,email,pwd (send by client)
signature created by using secret Key(it is random)
